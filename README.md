# Logic in Computer Science — Assignment 2  
### Dafny Program Verification

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Logic in CS – Assignment 2**, which focuses on using the **Dafny programming language** for formal verification.

Dafny is a verification-aware language that allows us to prove program correctness through:
- **Preconditions**  
- **Postconditions**  
- **Loop invariants**  
- **Loop variants**  

The assignment consists of implementing four tasks and generating a verification report.
